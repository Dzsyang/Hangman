### How to start the game?
You can find that there is two files `arg.py` and `interface.py` in the latest release version.

- `arg.py`

"arg" means you can use command arguments to start the game, which is more *convenient* than `interface.py`.

Before you start to play the game, you should use "-h" or "--help" to find "HELP".

Then check the commands, and after that you will know how to start the game.

- `interface.py`

"interface" means you can start the game by the interface in the game, which is more *intuitive* than `arg.py`.

You can follow the prompts to start the game.

### What's the rule for this game?

#### The game has two modes. 

You can choose one mode depending on the number of the player(1 or 2).

#### The game has two roles.

- Thinker, who need to think a secret word. (In the one player mode, the computer is Thinker.)

- Guesser, who need to guess the word out before Thinker has drawn "Hangman", which means the death.

#### In general, this game is very simple and easy to get the way to play.

## *So, just have fun!*
